.SYNOPSIS
    Merges develop to main and pushes to all remotes.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script automates the release process:
    1. Verifies working directory is clean
    2. Pulls latest changes from develop
    3. Switches to main and pulls latest
    4. Merges develop into main (fast-forward when possible)
    5. Runs tests to verify the merge
    6. Pushes main to all configured remotes
    7. Returns to the develop branch

.PARAMETER SkipTests
    Skip running tests after the merge (not recommended).

.PARAMETER DryRun
    Show what would happen without actually doing it.

.PARAMETER Force
    Skip confirmation prompts.

.EXAMPLE
    .\create-release.ps1
    # Interactive release with confirmation and tests

.EXAMPLE
    .\create-release.ps1 -DryRun
    # Show what would happen without making changes

.EXAMPLE
    .\create-release.ps1 -Force -SkipTests
    # Non-interactive release without tests (use with caution)
