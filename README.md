A PowerShell module for organizing scripts, executables, and CLI tools using command proxies. Stop cluttering your PATH - organize your tools into logical namespaces and access them through a single entry point.

## The Problem

As your collection of PowerShell scripts and CLI tools grows, you face a common challenge:

- Scripts scattered across multiple directories
- Adding every folder to PATH becomes unmanageable
- No logical organization for related tools
- Difficult to remember where each tool lives

## The Solution

PowerStub creates **command proxies** (called "stubs") that serve as namespaced entry points to your organized tools:

```powershell
# Instead of remembering paths or adding to PATH:
C:\Tools\DevOps\Scripts\Deployment\deploy-app.ps1 -Environment prod

# Use a simple, organized command:
pstb DevOps deploy-app -Environment prod
```

## Features

- **Namespace Organization**: Group related tools under logical stub names
- **Tab Completion**: Full IntelliSense for stub names, commands, and parameters
- **Dynamic Parameters**: Automatically inherits parameters from target commands
- **Multi-format Support**: Works with `.ps1` scripts and `.exe` executables
- **Lifecycle Prefixes**: Built-in support for `alpha.*` and `beta.*` command stages
- **Zero PATH Pollution**: Single alias (`pstb`) provides access to all your tools
- **Built-in Commands**: Search across stubs and get help for any command
- **Direct Aliases**: Create shortcut aliases for frequently used stubs
- **Git Integration**: Automatic detection and updates for Git-based stub repositories

## Installation

### Option 1: From PowerShell Gallery (Recommended)

The easiest way to install PowerStub:

```powershell
# Install from PowerShell Gallery
Install-Module -Name PowerStub -Scope CurrentUser

# Import the module
Import-Module PowerStub

# Add to your PowerShell profile for persistent use
Add-Content $PROFILE "`nImport-Module PowerStub"
```

### Option 2: From GitHub Release

Download a specific release from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DevPossible/power-stub/releases):

1. Download the latest release `.zip` file
2. Extract to a folder (e.g., `C:\Modules\PowerStub`)
3. Import the module:

```powershell
# Import from extracted location
Import-Module C:\Modules\PowerStub\PowerStub.psd1

# Add to your PowerShell profile for persistent use
Add-Content $PROFILE "`nImport-Module 'C:\Modules\PowerStub\PowerStub.psd1'"
```

### Option 3: From Source (Development)

Clone the repository for development or to get the latest changes:

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/DevPossible/power-stub.git

# Import the module from source
Import-Module ./power-stub/PowerStub/PowerStub.psm1

# Add to your PowerShell profile for persistent use
Add-Content $PROFILE "`nImport-Module 'C:\path\to\power-stub\PowerStub\PowerStub.psm1'"
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Create a New Stub

```powershell
# Register a stub for your DevOps tools
New-PowerStub -Name "DevOps" -Path "C:\Tools\DevOps"
```

This creates the following folder structure:

```text
C:\Tools\DevOps\
├── Commands\       # Your commands go here
└── .tests\         # Test files
```

### 2. Add Commands

Place your scripts or executables in the `Commands` folder:

```powershell
# C:\Tools\DevOps\Commands\deploy-app.ps1
param(
    [Parameter(Mandatory)]
    [string]$Environment,

    [string]$Version = "latest"
)

Write-Host "Deploying to $Environment with version $Version"
```

#### Complex Commands with Supporting Files

For commands that need helper scripts, data files, or executables, create a subfolder with the command name. Only the file matching the folder name is exposed as a command:

```text
Commands/
├── simple-task.ps1              # Exposed as "simple-task"
├── quick-deploy.exe             # Exposed as "quick-deploy"
└── complex-deploy/              # Subfolder for complex command
    ├── complex-deploy.ps1       # Exposed as "complex-deploy"
    ├── deploy-helper.ps1        # NOT exposed (helper script)
    ├── config.json              # NOT exposed (data file)
    └── validator.exe            # NOT exposed (helper executable)
```

This prevents helper scripts from appearing in tab completion or being accidentally invoked as commands.

### 3. Use Your Commands

```powershell
# Tab completion works for stub names
pstb Dev<TAB>  # Completes to "DevOps"

# Tab completion works for commands
pstb DevOps dep<TAB>  # Completes to "deploy-app"

# Tab completion works for parameters
pstb DevOps deploy-app -Env<TAB>  # Completes to "-Environment"

# Execute the command
pstb DevOps deploy-app -Environment prod -Version 2.0.1
```

## Core Commands

### Stub Management

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `New-PowerStub -Name <name> -Path <path>` | Register a new stub and create folder structure |
| `Remove-PowerStub -Name <name>` | Unregister a stub (files remain) |
| `Get-PowerStubs` | List all registered stubs |
| `Get-PowerStubCommand -Stub <name> -Command <cmd>` | Get command object details |

### Invocation

| Command | Alias | Description |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `Invoke-PowerStubCommand -Stub <name> -Command <cmd>` | `pstb` | Execute a command from a stub |
| `pstb` (no args) | | Show overview with stubs and built-in commands |
| `pstb <stub>` (no command) | | List commands in the stub |

### Built-in Commands

These virtual commands work across all stubs without needing script files:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pstb search <query>` | Search commands by name or help text across all stubs |
| `pstb help <stub> <command>` | Display PowerShell help for a specific command |
| `pstb update [stub]` | Update Git repositories for stubs |

```powershell
# Find all commands related to "deploy"
pstb search "deploy"

# Get detailed help for a command
pstb help DevOps deploy-app

# Update all Git-tracked stubs
pstb update

# Update a specific stub's Git repository
pstb update DevOps
```

### Direct Aliases

Create shortcut aliases for frequently used stubs:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `New-PowerStubDirectAlias -AliasName <alias> -Stub <stub>` | Create a direct alias for a stub |
| `Remove-PowerStubDirectAlias -AliasName <alias>` | Remove a direct alias |

```powershell
# Create a short alias for your DevOps stub
New-PowerStubDirectAlias -AliasName "do" -Stub "DevOps"

# Now use the shorter syntax
do deploy-app -Environment prod    # Same as: pstb DevOps deploy-app -Environment prod
do                                 # List commands in DevOps

# Remove the alias when no longer needed
Remove-PowerStubDirectAlias -AliasName "do"
```

Direct aliases are persisted and automatically restored when the module loads.

```powershell
# Promote a command from production to alpha (work-in-progress)
Set-PowerStubCommandVisibility -Stub DevOps -Command deploy -Visibility Alpha

# Promote to beta testing
Set-PowerStubCommandVisibility -Stub DevOps -Command deploy -Visibility Beta

# Release to production
Set-PowerStubCommandVisibility -Stub DevOps -Command deploy -Visibility Production
```

## Configuration File

PowerStub stores its configuration in `PowerStub.json`, located in the module directory (alongside `PowerStub.psm1`):

```json
{
  "Stubs": {
    "DevOps": "C:\\Tools\\DevOps\\",
    "Database": "C:\\Tools\\Database\\"
  },
  "InvokeAlias": "pstb",
  "EnablePrefix:Alpha": false,
  "EnablePrefix:Beta": false
}
```

### Configuration Keys

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| `Stubs` | Object | `{}` | Map of stub names to root paths (or config objects with GitRepoUrl) |
| `InvokeAlias` | String | `pstb` | Alias for `Invoke-PowerStubCommand` |
| `EnablePrefix:Alpha` | Boolean | `false` | Include `alpha.*` prefixed commands |
| `EnablePrefix:Beta` | Boolean | `false` | Include `beta.*` prefixed commands |
| `GitEnabled` | Boolean | `true` | Enable Git integration (auto-detected on load) |

## Command Lifecycle

PowerStub supports organizing commands by development stage using filename prefixes:

```text
YourStub/Commands/
├── alpha.new-feature.ps1   # Work in progress (Enable-PowerStubAlphaCommands)
├── beta.deploy-v2.ps1      # Beta testing (Enable-PowerStubBetaCommands)
├── deploy.ps1              # Production-ready (always visible)
└── complex-task/           # Subfolder for complex command
    ├── alpha.complex-task.ps1   # Alpha version (file matches folder name)
    └── complex-task.ps1         # Production version
```

**Prefix conventions:**

- `alpha.*` - Work-in-progress commands (developer mode)
- `beta.*` - Beta/experimental commands (tester mode)
- No prefix - Production-ready commands

**Workflow:**

1. Create new commands with `alpha.` prefix (e.g., `alpha.my-feature.ps1`)
2. Rename to `beta.` prefix when ready for testing
3. Remove prefix for production use

**Resolution precedence:** `alpha.*` → `beta.*` → production (no prefix)

When multiple versions exist (e.g., `alpha.deploy.ps1`, `beta.deploy.ps1`, `deploy.ps1`),
the command resolves in precedence order based on enabled modes. This applies to both direct files and files in subfolders.

## Git Integration

PowerStub integrates with Git to help you keep your stub repositories up to date.

### Automatic Detection

When you register a new stub with `New-PowerStub`, PowerStub automatically detects if the path is part of a Git repository and saves the remote URL in the configuration.

```powershell
# If C:\Tools\DevOps is a Git repo, the remote URL is saved automatically
New-PowerStub -Name "DevOps" -Path "C:\Tools\DevOps"
```

### Update Notifications

When the PowerStub module loads, it checks each Git-tracked stub to see if it's behind the remote repository:

```text
Stub 'DevOps' is 5 commit(s) behind the remote repo. Run 'pstb update DevOps' to update.
```

### Updating Repositories

Use the `update` command to pull the latest changes:

```powershell
# Update all Git-tracked stubs
pstb update

# Update a specific stub
pstb update DevOps
```

### Configuration

Git integration is enabled by default when Git is available. You can disable it:

```powershell
# Disable Git integration
Set-PowerStubConfigurationKey 'GitEnabled' $false

# Re-enable Git integration
Set-PowerStubConfigurationKey 'GitEnabled' $true
```

## Examples

### Register Multiple Stubs

```powershell
New-PowerStub -Name "DevOps" -Path "C:\Tools\DevOps"
New-PowerStub -Name "Database" -Path "C:\Tools\Database"
New-PowerStub -Name "Azure" -Path "C:\Tools\Azure"

# View all stubs
Get-PowerStubs
# Output:
# Name                           Value
# ----                           -----
# DevOps                         C:\Tools\DevOps\
# Database                       C:\Tools\Database\
# Azure                          C:\Tools\Azure\
```

### Work with Alpha Commands

```powershell
# Enable alpha visibility
Enable-PowerStubAlphaCommands

# Now alpha.* prefixed commands appear in completion
pstb DevOps <TAB>  # Shows both production and alpha commands

# Run an alpha command (no need to type the prefix)
pstb DevOps my-feature  # Executes alpha.my-feature.ps1

# Disable when done developing
Disable-PowerStubAlphaCommands
```

### Use with Executables

PowerStub works with `.exe` files too:

```powershell
# Place terraform.exe in your stub folder
# C:\Tools\DevOps\Commands\terraform.exe

# Use it through PowerStub
pstb DevOps terraform init
pstb DevOps terraform plan -out=tfplan
```

## Development

This section covers local development and testing of the PowerStub module.

### Prerequisites

- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- [Pester](https://pester.dev/) v5.x or later for running tests

```powershell
# Install Pester if not already installed
Install-Module Pester -Force -SkipPublisherCheck
```

### Local Development Workflow

#### 1. Clone and Set Up

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/DevPossible/power-stub.git
cd power-stub
```

#### 2. Load the Module for Testing

Use the `dev-reload.ps1` script to import the module from source:

```powershell
# Load/reload the module
.\dev-reload.ps1

# Load and reset configuration to defaults
.\dev-reload.ps1 -Reset
```

This script:

- Removes any existing PowerStub module from the session
- Imports the module from local source (`PowerStub/PowerStub.psm1`)
- Shows module info and current configuration

#### 3. Make Changes

Edit files in the `PowerStub/` folder:

- **Public functions**: `PowerStub/Public/functions/` - Exported to users
- **Private functions**: `PowerStub/Private/functions/` - Internal helpers

After making changes, reload the module to test:

```powershell
.\dev-reload.ps1
```

#### 4. Run Tests

Use the `dev-test.ps1` script to run the Pester test suite:

```powershell
# Run all tests with detailed output
.\dev-test.ps1

# Run specific tests by name filter
.\dev-test.ps1 -Filter "*Alpha*"

# Run with minimal output
.\dev-test.ps1 -Output Normal

# Skip module reload (if already loaded)
.\dev-test.ps1 -SkipReload
```

#### 5. Interactive Testing

Test your changes interactively using the sample stub:

```powershell
# Reload module
.\dev-reload.ps1 -Reset

# Register the sample stub from tests
New-PowerStub -Name "Sample" -Path ".\tests\sample_stub_root" -Force

# Test command discovery
Get-PowerStubCommand -Stub "Sample" -Command "deploy"

# Test command execution
pstb Sample deploy -Environment "test"

# Test alpha/beta features
Enable-PowerStubAlphaCommands
pstb Sample new-feature -Name "MyFeature"
Disable-PowerStubAlphaCommands
```

### Test Structure

Tests are located in `tests/PowerStub.tests.ps1` and cover:

| Area | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Module Loading | Exports, aliases, private function isolation |
| Configuration | Get/set/reset configuration values |
| Stub Management | Register, remove, list stubs |
| Command Discovery | Direct files, subfolders, helper isolation |
| Alpha/Beta Prefixes | Enable/disable, precedence order |
| Command Execution | Parameter passing, output capture |
| Direct Aliases | Create, remove, tab completion for aliases |
| Virtual Verbs | Search and help built-in commands |

The `tests/sample_stub_root/` folder contains a pre-configured stub with various command types for integration testing.

### Adding New Features

1. **New public function**: Create in `PowerStub/Public/functions/Verb-PowerStub*.ps1`
2. **New private function**: Create in `PowerStub/Private/functions/*.ps1`
3. **Add tests**: Update `tests/PowerStub.tests.ps1`
4. **Update documentation**: Update README.md and CLAUDE.md

Functions are automatically loaded by the module - no manifest changes needed.

### Code Style

- Use approved PowerShell verbs (`Get-`, `Set-`, `New-`, etc.)
- Prefix public functions with `PowerStub`
- Include `[CmdletBinding()]` on all functions
- Use `$Script:` scope for module-level variables

## Requirements

- PowerShell 5.1 or later
- Windows (primary support)
